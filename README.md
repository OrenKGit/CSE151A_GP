# CSE151A_GP
Group Project for CSE151A

Things we need to do for Milestone 2:
- Create a GitHub ID :white_check_mark:
- Create a GitHub Repository :white_check_mark:
- Perform the data exploration step (i.e. evaluate your data, # of observations, details about your data distributions, scales, missing data, column descriptions) Note: For image data you can still describe your data by the number of classes, # of images, plot example classes of the image, size of images, are sizes uniform? Do they need to be cropped? normalized? etc.
- Plot your data. For tabular data, you will need to run scatters, for image data, you will need to plot your example classes.
- How will you preprocess your data? You should explain this in your readme.md file and link your jupyter notebook to it. Your jupyter notebook should be uploaded to your repo.
- Jupyter Notebook data download and environment setup requirements
